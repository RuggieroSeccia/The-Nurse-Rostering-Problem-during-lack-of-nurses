    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements a version of the NRP problem in the case the number of nurses is not enough to guarantee the satisfaction of the working condition regulations within the ward. __We consider the possibility that each nurse are asked to work more than one shift per day but up to $H^{\\max}$ hours per period__. To this aim, we assume that each nurse can work for a fraction  $(1-c)$ or $c$ of the shift respectively before or after their shift. E.g. by fixing $c=0.5$ we allow each nurse to work half shift more before or after their proper shift. This allow us to reduce the number of shifts with insufficient number of nurses while minimizing stress for the healthcare personnel by defining balanced schedules.\n",

    "Let us consider a department in a hospital with a given number of nurses $N$. We want to organize their shifts for the next $T$ days, e.g. $T=7$ one week or $T=30$ next month,  and for all the followings so to minimize the effort required by the staff to satisfy the demand. By contract, each nurse $i$ has to work $H_i$ hours over the time horizon $T$ (e.g. each nurse must work at least 36 hours per week, $H=36$ and $T=7$). If the $i$th nurse works for a number of hours higher than $H_i$, then it is counted as extra work and then paid more by the healthcare structure. Each day three shifts need to be covered by the nurses: Morning, Afternoon, Night.\n",
